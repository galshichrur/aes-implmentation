# Crypto Implementations

Don't use this on production! Those implementations aren't secure. Find the vulnerabilities :)

This repository contains my own cryptography implementations written from scratch in Python.

Currently included:
- AES-128
- RSA

I will include in the future all AES modes modules working with this implmentation.
